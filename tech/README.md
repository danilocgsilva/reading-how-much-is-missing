## Design

First, you need to inform to the script the whole text body. Then, just enters strings, and the application will return all occurrences of desired term, if so, and still how much is missing until the end.

## Interface

Just a method that receives the string term. Returns an array. Empty if nothing found. Otherwise, contains the terms occurrences and its statistics.
